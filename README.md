A modified TaleSpin story generator, based on:

http://eliterature.org/images/microtalespin.txt

- Add Amazon-specific characters
- Allow randomization
- Allow importing of custom items (searched on amazon.com)

`alexa_story.py` is a basic script for managing the installation. It handles:

- searching Amazon.com for new items
- generating TTS for prompting the Echo
- generating the stories using the lisp script
- tweeting the finished story
